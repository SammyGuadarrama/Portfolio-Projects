# Welcome to Sammy Guadarrama's Portfolio!

In these folders, you will find highlights of my skills in data analysis and visualization. Here's how to navigate them:

### End-to-End Projects
- This folder contains all the relevant files for each project I've completed.
- For example, my [COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization Project](https://github.com/SammyGuadarrama/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/End-to-End%20Projects/COVID-19%20Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization%20Project) in this folder contains the data I analyzed, my analysis using SQL, the views I created for visualization purposes, and the Tableau file with my visualizations of the data.
- The files in these folders that contain my own work all follow the same format: 'Project Topic - Coding Language or Tool - Project Type'. For example, as part of the above project, I performed an analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL, which is found in this file: [COVID-19 - SQL - Data Analysis](https://github.com/SammyGuadarrama/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/End-to-End%20Projects/COVID-19%20Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Visualization%20Project/COVID-19%20-%20SQL%20-%20Data%20Analysis.sql).
### Python & SQL Projects
- These two folders contain only code I wrote myself. If you want to see my skills in a particular coding language, check out these folders.
### Data Visualization Projects
- In addition to the projects you find here, be sure to check out my [Tableau Public Account](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samuel.guadarrama/vizzes) for the visualizations I've made using Tableau.
